# Invoice Anomaly Detection

This project identifies unusual and suspicious invoice patterns using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Manual invoice auditing is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project automates anomaly detection to identify potentially fraudulent invoices.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling
- Clustering and pattern discovery
- Dimensionality reduction for visualization

## Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Apriori Algorithm

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Learnings
- Unsupervised learning workflows
- Detecting anomalies without labeled data
- Business fraud detection use cases
